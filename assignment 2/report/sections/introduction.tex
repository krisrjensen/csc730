The first assignment of this course tasked us with implementing a Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm "from scratch" on a set of skewed data from the MNIST dataset. This skewed dataset contained eight classes from a total set of ten classes. Also, each class was not represented with equivalent frequency. The dataset contains 12244 records of data. Each record contains a 784-element list that represents a 28x28 image of a handwriting sample.

This report will detail the steps taken by our team to implement the FCM algorithm "from scratch" and determine the accuracy using the Rand Index Metric.

All code was executed in python on VS code.
