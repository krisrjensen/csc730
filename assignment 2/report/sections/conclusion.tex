The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm was successfully implemented "from scratch" on the sqewed MNIST dataset and the rand index metric was used to determine the accuracy. Additionally, the algorithm was run using initial cluster amounts $[2,10]$ inclusive and determined that the rand index was relatively similar for all cluster amounts within the domain, with slight increase in three clusters in PCA, and four clusters for the all dimension representation of the sqewed MNIST dataset. Future work can be done to determine how different sqewed representations of the MNIST dataset will produce similar or different optimum cluster amounts.
