The requirements for this assignment are as follows~\cite{assignment9}.\par
\begin{enumerate}    
    \item Get the provided datasets from D2L. Then for each dataset:
    \item Visualize the data w/ labels using 2 or 3-D tSNE.
    \item Write your own version of an active learning rare class discovery algorithm.
    \item Run your code on the dataset and keep track of the number of classes discovered vs. number of
    queries.
    \item Plot that (\# classes discovered vs. \# queries).
    \item Rerun the same experiment using a random query strategy.
    \item Plot the results from the random algorithm on the same plot.    
\end{enumerate}
