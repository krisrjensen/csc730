\section{Conclusion}

In this assignment, we implemented an active learning rare class discovery algorithm and evaluated its performance on the provided datasets. The results show that the active learning approach was able to discover all the classes in the dataset with significantly fewer queries compared to a random query strategy.

The data visualization techniques, particularly the 3D t-SNE plot and the interactive movie, provided valuable insights into the structure of the datasets and helped inform the development of the active learning algorithm.

Future work could involve exploring alternative query strategies, investigating the impact of different classifier models, and analyzing the performance of the algorithm on a wider range of datasets with varying levels of class imbalance and rarity.
