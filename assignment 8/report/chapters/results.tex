\section{Results and Discussion}

There were a total of 10 trining simulations ran for this assignment. These simulations were broken up by two classifiers and five query strategies.
 The classifiers used were the SVM and the Random Forest. The query strategies used were Random, highest uncertainty, highest confidence, entropy, and lowest vote. 
 The results of these simulations are shown in the following tables.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
~& Highest & Highest &~&~&Lowest \\
Classifier & Uncertainty & Confidence & Random & Entropy & Vote  \\\hline
Rand Forest & 232 & 557 & 339 & 256 & 203 \\ \hline
SVM & 175 & 632 & 270 & 855 & 195 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}

The training was performed to a stopping condition of either 95\% accuracy for the worst performing class or 1000 iterations.
None of the simulations reached the 1000 iteration stopping condition. The SVM classifier performed better than the Random Forest classifier in most cases.
