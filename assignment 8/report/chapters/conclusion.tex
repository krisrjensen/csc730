\section{Conclusion}

We were succesful in implementing an active learning algorithm to train a classifier on a dataset of 60000 samples using only a small set of those samples. 
The algorithm was able to reach a 95\% accuracy in far less than 1000 iterations.\par
The SVM classifier performed better than the Random Forest classifier in most cases. 
The highest uncertaintity query strategy was the most effective query strategy for the SVM classifier. 
The query by committee strategy was the most effective query strategy for the Random Forest classifier. The random query strategy proved to be a quite effective query strategy for both classifiers. 
The entropy query strategy provided mixed results for each classifier.\par
Due to the size of the graphs, they are added to the appendix.
