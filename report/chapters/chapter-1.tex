\section{Introduction}
For assignment 5 we are tasked to learn about ADBench, a so-called anomaly detection toolset. 
This toolset is a compilation of 57 datasets and 30 anomaly detection algorithms. These algorithms
can be classified as supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised. ADBench was
presented in a paper by Han et al. in 2022 and at the 36th Conference on Neural 
Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2022). The paper is titled "AD-Bench: A Benchmark for Anomaly Detection in High-Dimensional Data"\ \cite{han2022adbench}.

The assignement objectives are listed in the next section. One of the common themes of this assignment is the re-utilization of the 'skewed$\_$MNIST` dataset.
In this report we will discuss the installation of ADBench, the application of two algorithms to the `skewed$\_$MNIST` dataset, and the characterization of the results.
