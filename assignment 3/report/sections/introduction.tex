Our task with assignment three is to describe the OptiGrid algorithm, analyze the Optigrid code available on Github [1], in great detail. 
After analyzing the algorithm and the code, we will modify the demo example to accept a 2D dataset of 30000 points and create visualizations of the data points and cutting planes. 
If time permits, we can earn extra credit by extending the modifications and visualization to a 3D dataset of 30000 points.
