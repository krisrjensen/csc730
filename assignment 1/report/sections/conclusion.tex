Multiple methods were explored throughout this assignment including: count difference from the mean squared and unsquared,
univariate Gaussian distribution likelihood, fft. All three methods performed considerably better than a random guess approach,
as discussed in the results section. Additionally, when reconstructing class counts for each method, the fft approach resulted in
a 93\% simularity with the original data, while resulting in a 48\% identification accuracy, which shows significant improvements
to the fft anomolous accuracy can be obtained with future research. This is significantly better than the random guess,
difference from the mean, and univariate Gaussian which recieved simularity scores of 43\%, 78\%, and 80\% respectively.
