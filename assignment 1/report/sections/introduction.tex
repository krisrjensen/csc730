The first assignment of this course tasked us with analyzing a set of skewed data from the MNIST dataset. This skewed dataset contained eight classes from a total set of ten classes. Also, each class was not represented with equivalent frequency. The dataset contains 12244 records of data. Each record contains a 784-element list that represents a 28x28 image of a handwriting sample.

This report will detail the steps taken by our team to generate an anomaly score for each image and compare our results for accuracy.

We used two primary toolsets to perform the analysis. One toolset was python executed on VS code and the other was python executed on Google Colab.
