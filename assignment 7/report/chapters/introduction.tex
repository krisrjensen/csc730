\section{Introduction}
Anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, from fraud detection in financial transactions to identifying rare diseases in medical diagnosis. Traditional anomaly detection methods often focus on profiling normal instances and identifying instances that deviate from this normal profile. However, a novel approach called Isolation Forest (iForest) takes a fundamentally different approach by explicitly isolating anomalies instead of profiling normal points \cite{liu2008isolation}.

In this assignment, we implement the Isolation Forest algorithm from scratch and evaluate its performance on a dataset provided by the instructor. The dataset contains normal and anomalous instances, and our goal is to assess the effectiveness of the Isolation Forest algorithm in detecting anomalies.
