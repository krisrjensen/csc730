\section{Introduction}
In this assignment, we generate Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves using the MNIST and MNIST-C data on a probability density-based anomaly detection method of our choice. 
The MNIST-C dataset is a corrupted version of the original MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits. 
The MNIST-C dataset introduces various types of corruption to these images, such as blurring, noise, and pixelation, making it a challenging dataset for standard MNIST recognition algorithms.
Our goal is to generate a composite datset of normal and anomalous images, train a model on this dataset using a label set derived from the source location, and evaluate its performance using ROC and PR curves.
